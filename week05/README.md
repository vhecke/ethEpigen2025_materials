# Assignment

* Using peaks from ENCODE, identify bivalent domains (H3K27me3 + H3K4me3) from 
(mouse or human) embryonic stem cells (ESC)
* Question: what happens to those regions upon differentiation?
  * Choose *one* differentiated cell type (e.g. erythroblasts, fibroblast, B cells, etc.)
  * Download the H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 peaks from this cell type
  * How many of the mESC bivalent domains are, in this differentiated cell type, overlapping either mark or their combination (in this differentiated cell type)?

(You can use either mouse or human data, just make sure you do everything with the same species!)
