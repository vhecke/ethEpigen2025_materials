# Assignment

* Choose a transcription factor, e.g. CREB1, REST, GATA5, EGR1, GCR
(or any of your choice that has a motif and available ChIPseq data)
* Download the (e.g. Mouse) peaks for that factor (in whatever cell type)
* Identify the instances of the factor's motif
* Answer the following questions:
  * Of all the peaks, what proportion contains a motif for the factor?
    - Expected form of an answer: of the XX peaks, XX (XX%) contain a motif
  * Of all instances of that motif in the genome (or in one chromosome), what proportion is bound by the factor (i.e. has a peak)?
    - Expected form of an answer: of the XX motif instances, XX (XX%) overlap a peak
