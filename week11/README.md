# Assignment

1. Plot a heatmap of the methylation levels of the genes in top 5 DMR regions located on chr1. You may either do this as we did for promoters during the practical (i.e. using `getMeth()`), or using `signal2Matrix()` and `plotEnrichedHeatmaps()`.
    
    
2. Run an enrichment analysis (rGREAT) of the significant DMRs from the practical (see the [dmr.rds](https://github.com/ETHZ-INS/ethEpigen2025_materials/tree/main/week11/dmr.rds) file) vs the entire genome. Describe what your enrichment analysis is testing exactly & describe the results.   
    
Save your assignment in a R markdown named assignment.Rmd, render it, and push the html file to this folder in your github repository
